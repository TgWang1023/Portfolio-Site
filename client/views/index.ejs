                    Welcome to my website! I am a UCSB computer science student who loves to code. 
                    I am quite enthusiastic about anything technology related and have made quite a lot
                    of web apps and mobile apps whether for the goal to better our community or simply 
                    just for fun! Ever since I was exposed to programming, I gradually delved deeper and 
                    deeper into the realm of software development. From my first hello world program written 
                    in Java, to the OOP concepts in C++, then to full-scale web applications written in Python, 
                    node and mobile apps written in swift, I have trully grown as a developer.
                    
                    In addition to my coding skills, one thing that I really pride myself on 
                    is my language skills. I can speak English and Chinese to the point that 
                    people cannot determine what my mother tongue is! I am also a firm believer 
                    in the power of learning and I would always take at least few hours each week 
                    to catch up on the latest tech. I hope I can apply my skills to the real world 
                    and be a part of something great.
